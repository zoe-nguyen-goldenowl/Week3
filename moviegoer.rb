In this exercise you will build out rules for a movie theater's website.

task1: Check if a moviegoer is entitled to the seniors' discount
The theatre offers a discount for "old-age-pensions". Anyone who is 60 or older pays 10.00 for a ticket. 
Anyone younger pays the full 15.00.
Write the Moviegoer#ticket_price method using a ternary statement.

task2: Check if a moviegoer is allowed to see scary movies
The cinema has a simplified age-verification system. If you are 18 or over you can watch scary movies. If you are younger,
you cannot.
Implement the Moviegoer.watch_scary_movie? method. It should return whether someone is allowed to watch the movie or not.

task3: Check if a moviegoer is entitled to free popcorn

The cinema has a Movie Club program. Members get free popcorn when they watch any movie.

Implement the Moviegoer.claim_free_popcorn! method. If a viewer is a movie club member, they should be rewarded with their
free popcorn. If they are not, the method should raise the NotMovieClubMemberError exception defined at the top of the code.
